# PostToolUse hook: nudge the agent if no beacon has been emitted recently,
# OR if no beacon has been emitted at all in a session that's been alive
# past a grace period.
#
# Two accuracy constraints discovered in real sessions (2026-06-10 debugging,
# see skills-progress-beacon README "Nudge paths and rate limiting"):
#   1. Claude Code persists mid-turn assistant messages to the session JSONL
#      with multi-minute lag (sometimes never, for text-only mid-turn
#      messages). A beacon the agent just emitted can be invisible to
#      claude-walker for minutes. Thresholds must ride that out.
#   2. PostToolUse fires once per tool call, including per call in a parallel
#      batch. Without rate limiting one stale window produces a nudge burst
#      (observed: 10+ identical nudges in recorded incident sessions).
# Hence: a per-session cooldown gates BOTH nudge paths, and the staleness /
# grace thresholds are set well above the observed flush lag.
set -euo pipefail

# Seconds between nudges for one session (both paths share the stamp).
NUDGE_COOLDOWN=300
# Stale path: a live (non-end) beacon older than this triggers a nudge.
# Keep comfortably above typical JSONL flush lag so just-emitted beacons
# aren't nagged about.
STALE_AFTER=600
# Missing path: no beacon at all and the session is older than this.
